                    <h3>Is This It</h3>
                    <img src="images/is_this_it.jpeg" alt="Is This It" width="200" height="200" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>Is This It is the debut studio album by American rock band the Strokes, first released on July 30, 2001, through RCA Records. It was recorded at Transporterraum in New York City with producer Gordon Raphael during March and April 2001. For their debut, the band strived to capture a simple sound that was not significantly enhanced in the studio. Building on the work of their 2001 debut EP, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth.</p>
                    <h3>Room on Fire</h3>
                    <img src="images/room_on_fire.jpeg" alt="Room on Fire" width="200" height="200" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>Room on Fire is the second studio album by American rock band the Strokes, released on October 28, 2003, through RCA Records. The record follows their 2001 debut Is This It and includes three singles: "12:51", "Reptilia", and "The End Has No End". The album title Room on Fire was drawn from a line in "Reptilia": "The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair." Many critics at the time noted that the album was arguably an extension of the band's 2001 debut.</p>
                    <h3>First Impressions of Earth</h3>
                    <img src="images/room_on_fire.jpeg" alt="First Impressions of Earth" width="200" height="200" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>First Impressions of Earth is the third studio album by American rock band the Strokes. It was released on January 3, 2006, through RCA Records, having been preceded by lead single "Juicebox" some weeks earlier. It is also the first album by the Strokes to have a Parental Advisory label on the cover. The album was recorded over a ten-month period at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with producer David Kahne. The album's cover photo is a Polaroid picture taken by bassist Nikolai Fraiture's girlfriend, Ilona Rubenstein.</p>
                    <h3>Angles</h3>

It is their first album since First Impressions of Earth (2006), their longest gap to date between studio albums. After touring in support of First Impressions of Earth, the Strokes went on an extended hiatus in 2007 and returned in 2009 with new material as well as a new touring line-up, with keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Gustavo Dudamel and guitarist Nick Valensi's cousin, guitarist and keyboardist Jeff Kite, joining the band. The album's lead single, "Under Cover of Darkness", was released on February 9, 2011, and reached number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

                    <img src="images/come_down.jpeg" alt="Comedown Machine" width="200" height="200" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>Comedown Machine is the fifth studio album by American rock band the Strokes. It was released on March 26, 2013, through RCA Records. The band decided to pull a media blackout for the album, with no promotion in the form of television appearances, interviews, photoshoots, live shows, or tours. The album's cover is a painting called "The Fragile" by Peter Phillips from 1964. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200.</p>
